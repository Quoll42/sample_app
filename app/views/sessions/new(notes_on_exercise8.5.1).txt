I am working on the same step of the tutorial, and your question helped me finding my way.

The use of label and text_field, instead of label_tag and text_field_tag is working fine, and you don't have to change the controller code (this produce the same HTML code as with the original form_for method).

<%= form_tag(sessions_path) do %>
  <%= label :session, :email %>
  <%= text_field :session, :email %>

  <%= label :session, :password %>
  <%= password_field :session, :password %>

  <%= submit_tag("Sign in", class: "btn btn-large btn-primary") %>
<% end %>
